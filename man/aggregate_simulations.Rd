\usage{
aggregate_simulations(
  files = NULL,
  filename = NULL,
  dirs = NULL,
  results_dirname = "SimDesign_aggregate_results",
  select = NULL,
  check.only = FALSE,
  target.reps = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{a \code{character} vector containing the names of the simulation's final \code{.rds} files}

\item{filename}{(optional) name of .rds file to save aggregate simulation file to. If not specified
then the results will only be returned in the R console}

\item{dirs}{a \code{character} vector containing the names of the \code{save_results} directories to be
aggregated. A new folder will be created and placed in the \code{results_dirname} output folder}

\item{results_dirname}{the new directory to place the aggregated results files}

\item{select}{a character vector indicating columns to variables to select from the
\code{SimExtract(what='results')} information. This is mainly useful when RAM is an issue
given simulations with many stored estimates. Default includes the results objects
in their entirety, though to omit all internally stored simulation results pass the
character \code{'NONE'}}

\item{check.only}{logical; for larger simulations file sets, such as those generated by
\code{\link{runArraySimulation}}, return the design conditions that do no satisfy the
\code{target.reps}}

\item{target.reps}{(optional) number of replications to check against to evaluate whether
the simulation files returned the desired number of replications. If missing, the highest
detected value from the collected set of replication information will be used}
}
\value{
if \code{files} is used the function returns a \code{data.frame/tibble} with the (weighted) average
  of the simulation results. Otherwise, if \code{dirs} is used, the function returns NULL
}
\description{
This function aggregates the results from SimDesign's \code{\link{runSimulation}} into a single
objects suitable for post-analyses, or combines all the saved results directories and combines
them into one. This is useful when results are run piecewise on one node (e.g., 500 replications
in one batch, 500 again at a later date) or run independently across different
nodes/computers that are not on the same network.
