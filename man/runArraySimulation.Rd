\title{Run a Monte Carlo simulation using array job submissions per condition}
\usage{
runArraySimulation(
  design,
  ...,
  replications,
  iseed,
  filename,
  dirname = NULL,
  arrayID = getArrayID(),
  filename_suffix = paste0("-", arrayID),
  addArrayInfo = TRUE,
  save_details = list(),
  control = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{design object containing simulation conditions on a per row basis.
This function is design to submit each row as in independent job on a HPC cluster.
See \code{\link{runSimulation}} for further details}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link{runSimulation}}}

\item{replications}{number of independent replications to perform per
condition (i.e., each row in \code{design}). See \code{\link{runSimulation}}
for further details}

\item{iseed}{initial seed to be passed to \code{\link{gen_seeds}}'s argument
of the same name, along with the supplied \code{arrayID}}

\item{filename}{file name to save simulation files to (does not need to
specify extension). However, the array ID will be appended to each
\code{filename} (see \code{filename_suffix}). For example, if
\code{filename = 'mysim'} then files stored will be \code{'mysim-1.rds'},
\code{'mysim-2.rds'}, and so on for each row in \code{design}}

\item{dirname}{directory to save the files associated with \code{filename}
to. If omitted the files will be stored in the same working directory
where the script was submitted}

\item{arrayID}{array identifier from the scheduler. Must be a number between
1 and \code{nrow(design)}. If not specified then \code{\link{getArrayID}} will
be called automatically, which assumes the environmental variables are available
according the SLURM scheduler}

\item{filename_suffix}{suffix to add to the \code{filename};
default add '-' with the \code{arrayID}}

\item{addArrayInfo}{logical; should the array ID and original design row number
be added to the \code{SimExtract(..., what='results')} output?}

\item{save_details}{optional list of extra file saving details.
See \code{\link{runSimulation}}}

\item{control}{control list passed to \code{\link{runSimulation}}.
  In addition to the original \code{control} elements two
  additional arguments have been added:
  \code{max_time} and \code{max_RAM}, both of which as specified as
  character vectors with one element.

  \code{max_time} specifies the maximum time allowed for a
  single simulation condition to execute (default does not set
  any time limits). This is primarily useful when the HPC cluster
  will time out after some known elapsed time.
  Following the \code{SBATCH} specifications, acceptable time formats include
  \code{"minutes"}, \code{"minutes:seconds"}, \code{"hours:minutes:seconds"},
  \code{"days-hours"}, \code{"days-hours:minutes"} and
  \code{"days-hours:minutes:seconds"}.
  For example, \code{max_time = "60"} indicates a maximum time of 60 minutes,
  \code{max_time = "03:00:00"} a maximum time of 3 hours,
  \code{max_time = "4-12"} a maximum of 4 days and 12 hours, and
  \code{max_time = "2-02:30:00"} a maximum of 2 days, 2 hours and 30 minutes.
  In general, this input should be set to somewhere around
  80-90% of the true termination time so that any evaluations completed
  before the cluster is terminated can be saved. Default applies no time limit

  Similarly, \code{max_RAM} controls the
  (approximate) maximum size that the simulation storage objects can grow
  before RAM becomes an issue. This can be specified either in terms of megabytes
  (MB), gigabytes (GB), or terabytes (TB). For example, \code{max_RAM = "4GB"} indicates that
  if the simulation storage objects are larger than 4GB then the workflow
  will terminate early, returning only the successful results up to this point).
  Useful for larger HPC cluster jobs with RAM constraints that could terminate abruptly.
  As a rule of thumb this should be set to around 90% of the maximum possible storage
  available. Default applies no memory limit}

\description{
This function has the same purpose as \code{\link{runSimulation}}, however
rather than evaluating each row in a \code{design} object (potentially with
parallel computing architecture) this function evaluates the simulation
per independent row condition. This is mainly useful when distributing the
jobs to HPC clusters where a job array number is available (e.g., via SLURM),
where the simulation results must be saved to independent files as they
complete. Use of \code{\link{expandDesign}} is useful for distributing replications
to different jobs, while \code{\link{gen_seeds}} is required to ensure high-quality
random number generation across the array submissions. See the associated
vignette for a brief tutorial of this setup.
}
\details{
Due to the nature of how the replication are split it is important that
the L'Ecuyer-CMRG (2002) method of random seeds is used across all
array ID submissions (cf. \code{\link{runSimulation}}'s \code{parallel}
approach, which uses this method to distribute random seeds within
each isolated condition rather than between all conditions). As such, this
function requires the seeds to be generated using
\code{\link{gen_seeds}} with the \code{iseed} and \code{arrayID}
inputs to ensure that each job is analyzing a high-quality
set of random numbers via L'Ecuyer-CMRG's (2002) method.

Additionally, for timed simulations on HPC clusters it is also recommended to pass a
\code{control = list(max_time)} value to avoid discarding
conditions that require more than the specified time in the shell script.
The \code{max_time} value should be less than the maximum time allocated
on the HPC cluster (e.g., approximately 90% of this time or less, though
depends on how long each replication takes). Simulations with missing
replication information should submit a new set of jobs at a later time
to collect the missing replication information.
